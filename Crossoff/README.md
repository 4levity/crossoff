# Crossoff Android app #

Crossoff app works with crossoff-server to scan barcodes using an Android device camera.

On a successful barcode scan, it will attempt to contact crossoff-server at this hardcoded address:

    http://10.0.2.2:8080

Note that 10.0.2.2 is also the address of the host machine's localhost for an Android Virtual Device.
